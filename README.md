# Lesson Notes from Fast AI Deep Learning Part II
I love the freedom that writing in markdown provides. It is clean and at the same time allows many complex formatting, including equations and images. It will be my default tool for writing my notes during the class. I hope to be useful for those who want to quickly recap some topic that we've seen.

## Note
The document is mostly made from notes that I typed while in the class, that's why it is messy sometimes. It is a work in progress. When watching the class again I will be continuously updating the notes.
