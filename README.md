# Class Notes from Fast AI Pt II
I love the freedom that writing in markdown provides. It is clean and at the same time allows many complex formatting, including equations and images. It will be my default tool for writing my notes during the class. I hope to be useful for those who want to quickly recap some topic that we've seen. It is still a little chaotic and a work-in progress.
