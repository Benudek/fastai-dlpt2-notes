# Deep Learning Part II: Deep learning from the foundations

## Some logistics
- Room 153 @ USF (101 Howard ST)
- In person 
- International visotiors prior

## Intro
- Very different part II
- Implement fastai library from foundations
    - Basic matrix calculus
    - Training loops
    - Optimizers customized
    Customized annealing
- Read papers
- Solve applications that are not fully backed
- In the end, implement on Swift
- Cutting edge is really about engineer, not about papers
    - Who can bake that things in code
- Part II will be more about bottom up (with code)

## Embracing Swift for Deep Learning
- Chris
    - Built compilers, C for Mac
    - Built the most recent language
    - Currently dedicating his life to deep learning
- Julia has pottential as well!
- S4TF Pros
    - Write everything in swift
    - See whats happening
    opportunities
- Cons
    - Minimal Ecosystem
    - Very little works
    - Lots to learn
